# BOOKSTORE ECOMMERCE MERN APP

This project is a Full-Stack Web application that simulates a online bookster, and that uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js) to
implement the Back-End (Node.js, Express, MongoDB), and the Front-End (React.js, JavaScript).

In the /api/books endpoint, the user can retrieve the list of available books in the bookstore.

In the Front-End, the user can filtera, and sort the list of books using different criteria, such as Price Range
(Min. Price - Max. Price), and filter by type (Philosophy, History, Fiction).

In the Front-End, the user can use buttons to add the books of his/her preference to the shopping cart, and the
total price of the purchase will be calculated and displayed on th top of the screen.

A counter will show the user the amount of items added to the shopping cart.

The user also can remove items from the shopping cart using another button.

The applications is visually appealing, uses a beautiful balance of colors, and is responsibe for being used in different screen sizes.
